This repository contains tooling to quickly set up Travis CI on SUSE
and openSUSE documentation repositories.

Currently, setting up this repository means that the following checks
will be run automatically:

* XML validation with DAPS (using `Geekodoc <https://github.com/openSUSE/geekodoc>`_ for DocBook 5 content)
* Check for missing images

Additionally, you can use Travis CI to push live builds to susedoc.github.io.
For details, see https://github.com/openSUSE/doc-ci#travis-draft-builds


Enabling Travis for Doc Repositories
====================================

If you want doc repos to be checked with Travis, follow the steps in the
following sub sections.


.. _sec-activate-travis:
Activating Travis Web UI
------------------------

Before you can use Travis, you need to activate the respective
repository on our SUSE page:

1. Open https://travis-ci.org/profile/SUSE and search for your repository.
   If you cannot find it, click the "Sync account" button on the upper right
   corner.

2. Enable the doc repo in Travis.


.. _sec-configure-github:
Configuring the GitHub Web UI
-----------------------------

Enable the Travis service in GitHub as follows:

1. Open your repo's "Settings" page.

2. Under "Integrations & services", choose "Add service" > "Travis CI"

3. Click "Add service"


.. _sec-configure-docrepos:
Configuring the Documentation Repository
----------------------------------------

Use the following final steps:

1. In your doc repo, create a feature branch (for example, ``feature/travis``):

    .. code::

    $ git checkout -b feature/travis

2. Copy the following files from this repo into your doc repo:

    * ``travis/template/.travis.yml`` - The main setup file for Travis
    * ``travis/template/Dockerfile`` - The main setup file for the openSUSE Docker container
    * ``.dockerignore`` - Files in your repo that should be ignored by Docker

3. [Optional] By default, Travis will run over DC files matching the pattern
    ``DC-*-all``. If none exist, it will use the pattern ``DC-*`` instead. To
    set up any other set of DC files to check, add a file named ``.travis-check-docs``
    to your repo. In this file, list the names of all DC files to check, separated by
    newlines (``\n``) or spaces.

4. Push the feature branch with:

    .. code::

        $ git push --set-upstream origin feature/travis

5. Wait and see for the results. If you encounter an issue, contact
    `@tomschr <https://github.com/tomschr/>`_ or `@sknorr <https://github.com/svenseeberg/>`_.

6. Merge your branch into ``develop``.


Travis Draft Builds
===================

We want to publish HTML builds of our public repositories on https://susedoc.github.io.
To build the documentation, we are using Travis CI which is already triggered
for each commit. Our default Travis CI script receives an environment variable from
the ``.travis.yml`` file with all branches that should be published. If the commit, that
Travis is currently validating, belongs to one of those branches, a build will
be triggered. Travis then needs to push the builds to the target repositories in
the SUSEDoc organization. For that, each target repository has a SSH public key
with write access that is used by Travis. The SSH private key is stored in
the corresponding source repository in an encrypted file. Travis uses an internal
private key to decrypt this SSH private key.

Configuring Travis CI
---------------------

To create draft builds of branches in a repository, first deploy Travis
CI as described in the previous section. Then follow this procedure:

1. Install the `Travis CLI <https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation>`.
   This can also be done on a machine you have SSH access to.

2. If you followed the guide from Travis on an openSUSE machine, set the
   following path after the installation:

   .. code::

      $ export PATH="/usr/lib64/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/travis-1.8.10/bin:$PATH"

   (Adapt the path to your installed version of Ruby and the ``travis`` tool.)

3. Create a new SSH key pair that can be used for deploying to GitHub
   pages and copy the encrypted private key to the documentation source
   code repository.

   a. Create a new directory and in it key pair in the current working directory.
      Do not set a password for the key file.

      .. code::

         $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "doc-team@suse.com" -f id_rsa

   b. Create a secret that will be used to encrypt the SSH private key:

      .. code::

         $ echo $(openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n') > secret

      Store the SSH key and also the secret in the internal doc-dotfiles
      repository (https://gitlab.suse.de/susedoc/doc-dotfiles/tree/master/ssh-travis).

   c. Encrypt the private key with the secret and copy the encrypted file
      to the documentation source repository.

      .. code::

         $ openssl aes-256-cbc -md md5 -pass "file:./secret" -in ./id_rsa -out ./ssh_key.enc -a
         $ cp ssh_key.enc /PATH/TO/XML/REPO/ssh_key.enc
         $ cat secret

      Copy and paste the string from the secret file. You will need it for
      the next step.
      The parameter ``-md md5`` is necessary to make sure that the same digest
      algorithm is used across various versions of OpenSSL (it probably also
      lowers security somewhat). For more information, see
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34304570 ).

   d. Create an environment variable named
      ``ENCRYPTED_PRIVKEY_SECRET`` that stores the secret and then we
      encrypt this full string to be included in the ``.travis.yml``

      .. code::

         $ travis encrypt -r SUSE/doc-repo ENCRYPTED_PRIVKEY_SECRET=INSERT_SECRET_STRING

      Take the result and in the ``.travis.yml`` replace the string
      ``ADD_ENCRYPTED_SECRET`` with the result. Do not copy the quotes from
      the result.

      Some details why we are doing this: Travis CI needs to decrypt
      the SSH private key file on every run. You can set environment
      variables in the Web UI of Travis CI for each repository. For
      additional security, we will again encrypt the secret that Travis
      needs to decrypt the SSH key. This is necessary because
      environment variables can leak over unwanted paths.

      To achieve this encryption, Travis CI has a private and public
      key for each repository. Travis CI keeps the private key and
      allows encrypting arbitrary data with the public key over its
      API.

4. Create a repository in the SUSEDoc organization and add the SSH public
   key as a deployment key.

5. Clone this repository locally, create a ``gh-pages`` branch in it and create
   an initial commit:

   .. code::

      $ git clone git@github.com:SUSEdoc/doc-repo doc-repo-publish && doc-repo-publish
      $ git checkout -b gh-pages
      $ git commit --allow-empty -m"Initial Commit"
      $ git push origin gh-pages


Setting Up a Git Branch to Publishing Builds
--------------------------------------------

1. Doc CI should already be set up. Refer to https://github.com/openSUSE/doc-ci#travis-draft-builds .

2. Configure builds and links to those builds using the instructions in
   https://github.com/SUSEdoc/susedoc.github.io/blob/master/README.md .

Docker Image susedoc/ci
=======================

Building a Docker Image for dockerhub.com
-----------------------------------------

1. Get openSUSE Leap base image from https://github.com/openSUSE/docker-containers-build/tree/openSUSE-Leap-42.3/x86_64

2. Get ``Dockerfile`` from doc-ci repo: https://github.com/openSUSE/doc-ci/raw/develop/build-docker-ci/Dockerfile

3. Place both files into one folder and run

   .. code::

      $ docker build ./

4. Tag the image and upload it

   .. code::

      $ docker tag IMAGE_ID susedoc/ci:openSUSE-42.3
      $ docker push susedoc/ci:openSUSE-42.3
